# Fcntl

```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int fcntl(int file_descriptor, int command, ... /* optional argument */);
```

## Purpose

## Usage


## Function Parameters
`file_descriptor`: This is the integer file descriptor on which you want to perform the operation.
It can be a file descriptor for a regular file, socket, pipe, or other I/O device.

`command`: This is an integer value that specifies the operation you want to perform on the file descriptor.
It can take various values, and each value corresponds to a different operation. Some common commands include:

F_DUPFD: Duplicate the file descriptor.
F_GETFD: Get file descriptor flags.
F_SETFD: Set file descriptor flags.
F_GETFL: Get file status flags.
F_SETFL: Set file status flags.
F_GETLK: Get record lock information.
F_SETLK: Set or clear record lock.
F_SETLKW: Set or clear record lock, and block if blocked by another process.

`Optional Argument`: Depending on the specific command used, there may be an optional third argument associated with it.
For example, if you're setting a file status flag using F_SETFD or F_SETFL, you would provide an additional argument with the flag value.

## Return Value
